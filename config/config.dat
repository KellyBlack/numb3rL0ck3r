;
; passwordSecurityHash variable The site uses a HMAC-SHA1 for
; authentication which requires a pass code. This is used to keep the
; password as well as generate cookies. You should change this
; initially, but be very careful about changing it later. If you
; change this after the site is set up then every password on the site
; will no longer match. This will force every user to get a new
; password. If you want to make sure everyone changes their password
; then changing this will force it to happen. It will also fill up
; your inbox with complaints!
